- 👋 Hi, I’m Paola, I've started coding 2 years ago and since then I never stopped.
     I learned coding at [codebar London](https://codebar.io/) pair programming workshops, where I had the opportunity to share my knowledge and discuss with other professionals and student.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, cultures, foreign languages, meeting new people. In love with visual arts; I like to express my creative personality through painting and cooking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and .net.
- 💞️ In a future I would like to collaborate on youth projects to create opportunities for those who endured hard childhood.
