- 👋 Hi, I’m Paola, I've started coding 2 years ago and since then I never stopped.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, cultures, foreign languages, cooking, reading and painting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and .net.
- 💞️ In a future I would like to collaborate on youth projects to create opportunities for those who endured hard childhood. 
- 📫 How to reach me
