👋 Hi, I’m Paola, this is my working github profile, but I've started coding in 2018 since then I never stopped.</br>
In October of that year, I joined [codebar London](https://codebar.io/) pair programming workshops, where I had the opportunity to share my knowledge and discuss with      other professionals and student. Now I am volunteering both as coach and organiser.

👀 I’m interested in a lot of things mainly realted to cultures, foreign languages and meeting new people. In love with visual arts; I like to express my creative personality through painting and cooking.

🌱 I’m currently learning C# and .net.

💞️ In a future I would like to collaborate on youth projects to create opportunities for those who endured hard childhood.
